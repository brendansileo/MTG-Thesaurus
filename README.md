Magic: The Gathering is a trading card card developed by Wizards of the Coast where players create decks of special cards that they use to battle against each other. The game is extremely old, which means that there are thousands of cards to choose from when creating your deck. Because of the myriad of options a player has, it can be very easy to forget about cards one hasn't worked with in a long time (or to have never even seen certain cards!). 

This program aims to help with this issue. It accepts the name of a card, and provides a list of similar cards along with a score to give a relative idea of how similar each card is.
